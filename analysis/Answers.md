**Top 5 Profit Margins (Target):** States with the highest margins (e.g., District of Columbia: 45.09%) should be analyzed to replicate their successful strategies (low discount, efficient shipping).

**Top Loss States (Avoid/Mitigate):** The states contributing the highest total losses are typically Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. These states demand immediate review due to high discounts and/or high shipping costs.

## 📦 **Product Analysis**
### 6. What is the distribution of sales by product category & which category generates the highest revenue and profit?

**Highest Revenue and Profit:** Technology is the clear leader in both total sales and total profit.

**Highest Margins:** Technology and Office Supplies have very healthy and similar profit margins (over 17%).

### 7. What are the top-selling or most profitable products in the superstore?

**Top-Selling (by Sales Amount):** Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier.

**Top-Profitable (by Profit):** Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier. Other highly profitable sub-categories include Copiers, Phones, Accessories, and Paper.

**Loss-Making Products (Avoid/Mitigate):** The sub-category Tables consistently generates significant losses, making it a critical area to review (pricing, supplier costs, shipping, or discontinue low-profit items).

**Highest Profit Margin (Target):** The Home Office and Corporate segments have a higher profit margin than the Consumer segment. This suggests that while Consumers buy more, Corporate and Home Office customers are more profitable per dollar of sale.

Orders consistently rise throughout the year, peaking in November/December and dropping in January/February.

### 10. What is the average shipping time for each ship mode?

The different shipping modes (Standard Class, Second Class, First Class, Same Day) have different average shipping times.

Standard Class is typically the slowest, and Same Day is the fastest.

### 11. How are discounts distributed and what is the impact of discounts on sales?

The discount distribution shows that the majority of discounted items are discounted at 20%. However, a small number of orders receive very large discounts (up to 80%), which are typically the transactions that result in the largest losses.

The data shows that high discounts (specifically those greater than 40%) often lead to negative profits/losses.

Discounts are concentrated in certain low-profit sub-categories like Tables and Bookcases (often in the 40-80% range in high-loss states like Texas and Illinois).
