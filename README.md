2. Added helper columns:
   - `Profit Margin` = `Profit / Sales`
   - `Discount Range` using nested IF formulas  
   - `Shipping Days` = `Ship Date – Order Date`

## 💡 Key Analytical Insight: Discount Profitability

The analysis revealed that discounts are the single largest driver of negative profit margin. The primary actionable insight is the clear threshold for when discounts transition from driving lower margin sales to causing significant losses.

| Discount Range | Total Profit | Profit Margin (%) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 0% | **+\$320,987.60** | **29.51%** |
| 10% - 20% | **+\$10,448.17** | **12.75%** |
| 20% - 30% | **+\$90,337.31** | **11.82%** |
| **30% - 40%** | **-\$12,748.36** | **-10.86%** |
| **40% - 50%** | **-\$25,550.16** | **-20.96%** |
| **> 50%** | **-\$97,065.48** | **-78.82%** |

**Conclusion:** The Superstore must re-evaluate any discount policy that authorizes discounts **above 20%**, as these ranges are directly responsible for the majority of the company's losses.
